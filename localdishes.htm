<p>Eskisehir has long since become a mythical city thanks to the diversity of its natural beauties, deep-rooted history and the embrace of different cultures. That is why we will not talk about the places you need to see or the natural beauties of long history. You already know these.</p>
<p>Tell the hospitable people, the youth of university and the air that the city is developing every day. That's why there are so many people around us who go to university and go to Eskişehir, seven belly living in this city and proud of it, Eskişehirli and burning with a longing for home in another city. And yes, they are never wrong in these love.</p>
<p>Let's just say that if you have not gone to Eskişehir yet we missed a lot of things and let's start talking about their delicious food. Of course, the food of this magnificent city which has many cultures for years has been influenced by all this diversity, and it has been various flavors from pastries to meat dishes. These dishes, which an experimenter will want to eat again and Eskişehirs do not miss from their tables, take man tickets.</p>
<p>A little note: Of course, when you go, do not forget to go around a Porsuk Brook and see the Odunpazari houses. Eskişehir'de not only food, everything is a beautiful separate.</p>

<h1>Balaban meatball</h1>
<p>One of the most famous and delicious dishes of the city is balaban dumplings, pancakes cut in tiny squares with bones of water, a tomato sauce, yoghurt and butter on top, and finally grill panes. It's a delicious meal for us, too.</p>
<p>Everyone who is away from Eskişehir is in the nose of balaban köfte, university youths are the reasons for falling in love with city. Even so, even balaban köfte is enough reason to declare yourself Eskişehir.</p>

<h1>Yufkalı büryan</h1>
<p>The wonderful flavor of rice and spices, which is boiled with bones and then separated from its bones, is stored in the dough that is made into flour and sent to the journey of the fir. A hoofed broom, a hidden paradise for palms, turns like a pomegranate and turns into a full feast when it leaves the stove. It is my pleasure not to touch you when you open a delicious ayran.</p>

<h1>Çibörek</h1>

<p> Although it is known as "çiğbörek" in general, this flavor, which is actually called "çibörek", is the most beautiful contribution of Crimean Tatars to Eskişehir. The combination of onion, mincemeat and various spices is the result of the delicious meeting of the paste with the dough. Almost every restaurant in Eskişehir offers different kinds of ribs with different materials.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend using it with yogurt or salted sauces.</p>

<h1>Kıygaşa</h1>

<p> In general, the taste made without putting something in it is turned into a more exquisite one, filled with minced meat in some places.</p>
<p>The people of Eskişehir knows, especially the days of eve and oil lamps, there is a tradition of baking and distributing to the neighbors. If you are a neighbor of Eskişehir you are in luck and you will definitely enjoy this taste.</p>

<h1>Met Helvası</h1>

<p>The main ingredients are flour, sugar, lemon, oil and water, the most famous of the city. It is very difficult to make this delicious dessert which is enriched with various nuts or cocoa. That's why it would be good to get it from the places where real masters work instead of doing it at home for a good meal</p>
